In the standard DCGANs, we are not able to control the output which is randomly generated by the generator. 
So, we Conditional GANs helps in controlling the output that is thrown by the generator by conditioning the Generator(G) on the label.
There is slight modification as compared to the objecctive function of standard DCGANs. The original paper points out the same

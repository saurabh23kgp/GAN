Generative Adversarial Networks comprise of a Generator(G) and a Discriminator(D). 

Generator(G) is a neural network that takes as input random noise and transforms it into a sample from the model distribution.

Discriminator(D) too is a neural network that distinguishes between output data(Fake) from the generator and training data samples(Real)

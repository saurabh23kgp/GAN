Applying transfer learning in the discriminator part of DCGAN to enhance the training performance. 
This task was performed as part of my summer internship. The original file with proper output was misplaced, but 
code is exact same that was executed to get the result. Also, the work was using Kaggles GPU hence the filepath is given accordingly.

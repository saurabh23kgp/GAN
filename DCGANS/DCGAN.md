DCGANs original paper( https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434 ). The concept was applied on Famous Celebreties (100k) dataset which is
publicaly available on Kaggle.

This work is a part of my summer internship. The code showing the output is lost but the code here is exact same that was used. Also,
this code was run on Kaggle's kernel to use to GPU to enhance the training speed. Hence the filepath is mentioned accordingly.

The original paper on this algorithm is https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004 . This algorithm is a more advanced version of Conditional GANs.
Also, this here I have applied this on publicaly available Facade dataset. 

Also, this work is a part of my summer internship. The code with proper output was lost, but this code is exact same work which was used then. Also, the work was done on Kaggle's kernel to use its GPU, hence the filepath is given accordingly.
